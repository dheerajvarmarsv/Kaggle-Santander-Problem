# Kaggle Santander Problem

This notebook focuses on solving the Santander Customer Satisfaction problem using different classifiers and feature selection techniques. The goal is to predict whether a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied based on various features.

Usage
The notebook is divided into several sections, each covering a specific task. Here's a summary of the tasks covered in the notebook:

Data Loading and EDA:

The notebook loads the training and test datasets from CSV files.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data's structure and distribution.
Feature Selection:

Variance Threshold and Correlation Matrix are used to select important features for the classifiers.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously.
Classifier Training and Evaluation:

Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and MLP Classifier are trained and evaluated using the selected features and tuned hyperparameters.
Accuracy scores and predictions are obtained for each classifier.
Results and Submission:

The trained models are used to predict the target variable for the test dataset.
The predictions are saved in CSV format for submission.
